In an attempt to get myself to write more consistently, I've decided to set
myself a challenge – write one article a day for a month documenting my progress
"re-learning" how to code. I'll be going over some of my weak points and
documenting how I'm improving on them, (hopefully) providing some useful
help/tips along the way.

Here's a few of the topics I plan on covering:

1. Data structures
2. Project ideas
3. Open web technologies – replacing Bootstrap and other frameworks with things
   like CSS Grid, for instance
4. Security – what I've worked on, how little front-end developers seem to be
   trained for it, etc.
5. Industry trends – e.g., NoSQL vs. SQL, GraphQL, JavaScript, Swift/Kotlin,
   etc.

Full disclosure: I fully expect that some of the initial articles I write will
be shit – at least relative to what I hope to write later. I'm part of the
latest trend of coders jumping into full-stack development, and I never went to
college to learn computer science. The vast majority of what I know and what I
learn is self-taught, and I'm always working on becoming less shitty.
