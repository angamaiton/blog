I feel aimless. It's been nearly two years since I started learning how to
program (and three jobs), and I'm not where I want to be. I can hardly bring
myself to apply to most jobs, I've contributed very little to open-source
projects, and I spent an entire week just installing Linux distros and redoing
my dotfiles.

At this point, I'm trying to figure out what I do next in my career – the
_actual_ answer to the "where do you see yourself in five years" question from
interviews. Traditionally, I've seen myself leading a startup. I was interested,
years ago, in building a new operating system to compete with Apple and Google –
a universal OS built for a decentralized world, not tied to one of the major
companies.

That's why I got into programming – as time has gone on, however, I've become
much less interested in spearheading that myself. It's still very much an
interest, but my biggest barrier is still _meeting other developers_.

Part of what interested me about programming was the idea of building a company
with other people – thus far, I've been awful about going out and trying to meet
said people, and I think if I ever want to advance from where I am right now, I
need to concentrate on that.

It's been nearly two years now, like I said, and I don't really feel that I have
much to show for it. I've built a few things, designed a few logos and sites for
people, had a couple of jobs, but nothing I've done has really had much meaning
yet – that's to be expected as a neophyte, but I've been doing this long enough
that I think it's time to decide whether I want to continue on as a developer or
move into another area.

I want to continue as a developer, but it's time for a change in how I work. I
need to focus more on projects and less on learning abstractly (admittedly one
of the most consistent pieces of advice I've gotten from asking people more
senior than myself). So, this week, I've taken on two projects for people – a
set of logos for a friend, and a "get things done" project/task manager for my
mother's work.

I'll post the links here when I have them done. [You shouldn't see this here
when they're posted.]
