        <p>
          I'm a writer, philosopher, designer, and programmer. In my short time
          on Earth, I've learned ~26 languages, travelled the world, lived in
          five different states, and gone from being a translator to (yet
          another) JavaScript developer to multitalented programmer. I listen to
          game soundtracks, build my own constructed languages and scripts,
          install Linux distroes for fun, and am always learning new things.
