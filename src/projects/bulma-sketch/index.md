I played around with quite a few UI frameworks, but there was one that caught my
interest a few months ago – Bulma. I wanted to plan out a few different websites
with it, but I couldn't find a Sketch template for it, so I made one.

**Flexbox**

Bulma is a modern, responsive CSS framework that makes use of flexbox and the
latest technologies. I use it a lot as a cleaner, simpler version of Bootstrap.
The way it uses columns and tiles really helps with layouts, and it's easily
adaptable to match my needs when designing for different platforms.

**Modular**

It's possible to just use parts of the framework, too – a lot of frameworks seem
to be heading in this direction, which is great. This particular framework is
very easy to use as individual bits and pieces. I'm even working on a set of
React components that make use of Bulma for my own projects.

**Modern**

I mentioned that Bulma feels cleaner than Bootstrap – the two are pretty similar
in many regards, but the syntax it uses (nav, column, is-half) is really
intuitive compared to some of the workarounds I'm used to with Bootstrap and
Material Design Lite.
